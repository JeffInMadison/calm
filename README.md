Calm prototype. Saw someone looking for a developer for 1-2 month contract to replicate their iOS app. I was curious how I might replicate some of the UI in Andorid so I whipped up a quick prototype. Here I was just playing with the feasability of a swipe to a new fragment where the background of that fragment would be a looping video with audio. It wasn't very smooth but worked. 

I could spend a lot more time tweaking to get that to work then they would like and didn't contact them.
